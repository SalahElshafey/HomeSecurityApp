## Overview

The **HomeSecurityApp** empowers homeowners to monitor and manage their property directly from their smartphone.  

Core functionalities include:
- User-friendly interface for managing devices and alerts.
- Real-time monitoring integration (e.g., IoT sensors, security cameras).
- Configurable alerts and notifications to keep users informed of potential security issues.

---

## Features

- üîê **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration with AndroidX support.  
- üè† **Device Dashboard**: Centralized screen to view and manage home security devices.  
- üì∏ **Camera Integration**: Stream or snapshot camera feeds (if hardware supported).  
- üì° **Alerts & Notifications**: Receive push notifications when unusual activity is detected.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Admin Controls**: Add/remove devices, configure thresholds, or manage settings.  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud/Local Support**: Configurable backend (Firebase or local DB, depending on setup).  

---

## Architecture

The app follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** principles for maintainability.  

- **UI Layer**: XML layouts with AndroidX views.  
- **Logic Layer**: Java classes for authentication, device management, and alerts.  
- **Data Layer**: Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore or SQLite (configurable).  
- **Build System**: Gradle with AndroidX support (`android.useAndroidX=true`).
